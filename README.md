Project Title: JavaScript Quiz

What was my motivation: To apply JavaScript and HTML to create a quiz. Use JavaScript techniques like append, querySelector, getElementByID, functions, and for loops. Learning these Javascripts skills while help me complete my future work daily. Also this gives me another project I can show off during my interview process in the future.

What I learend: Getting better with functions, variable use, and forloops. Getting use to querySelector and getElementByID. Much more JavaScript techniques which I'm getting better in using.
